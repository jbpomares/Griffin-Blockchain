# Griffin-Blockchain

Blockchain Miner Receives transactions from user or remote node, then seends transactions to a remote node. Incoming node messages are managed using a queue. A Merkle Tree and an eventual Merkle Root are generated as part of Transaction processing. Blockchain Blocks are then created using the Proof of Work algorithm.
